\begin{abstract}

The Serval Mesh network is an infrastructure-less network designed for use in disaster-recovery efforts.
To ensure its reliable functioning during deployment, the network must be thoroughly tested.
To test the network, the Serval team have developed a software emulator to allow them to test the network in various scenarios.

This emulator has several limitations however, and is unable to provide clear and chronologically ordered log files or any graphical output to testers.
This thesis covers the implementation of configurable network devices, expanding the capabilities of the frameworks to model the Serval Mesh.
Additionally, tools are developed to generate simpler and easily understood log files, and produce graphical representations of the network traffic throughout a test.

With these tools, several bugs were uncovered in core Serval code that limit its effectiveness in field deployments.
Further, the basis for comparing the emulated Serval Network and real-world tests was outlined for future developers to analyse the accuracy of this emulation.
With the development of these tools, the aims are furthered of the Serval Project to produce a reliable network to help save lives in disaster recovery efforts.

First, I would like to thank my both of my supervisors, Paul and Saeed for their support and assistance throughout this year.
Of particular note, I would like to thank Paul for his long-distance guidance and career advice from Arkaroola, and thank you for dealing with poor microphone quality and satellite-bandwidth Skype calls.


I would also like to thank Josh, Phil, and Maddi.
You have all provided some much-needed sanity throughout this year, particularly during the mad rush of end-year thesis writing.


A major thank you to my parents, this has been a crazy and stressful year — even without the Honours year, and I have nothing but thanks for the support and understanding you have had for me.

Finally, I would like to thank my girlfriend, Sierra. 
You have been an absolute pillar of support throughout this year, and I honestly don't know if I could have done this without you by my side.
